    "\n",
    "$$x^2 - 4x\\sin x + (2\\sin x)^2 = (x - 2\\sin x)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important observation since in its original form, it always nonnegative and so the bisection method wouldn't work.  Indeed, we always want it to change signs on our interval.  But note that any solution is also a solution of $x - 2\\sin x = 0$, so we may use that instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at a graph of the curve $y = x - 2\\sin x$ (e.g., using Desmos), we see that a solution looks to be somewhere in the interval $[1, 2]$.  So let's start with that.  If $f(x) = x - 2\\sin x$, then\n",

    "Since the sign at the midpoint is different than the one on the right endpoint, we update our interval to $[1.5, 2]$.  Now let's check the new midpoint:\n",

    "$$f(1.75) = 1.75 - 2\\sin 1.75\\approx -0.2180$$\n",
